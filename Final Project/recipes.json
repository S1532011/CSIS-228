        "description": "Cavatappi's twirly shape takes its name from the Italian word for “corkscrew.” Not only is it fun to eat, it's also practical: The pasta's many nooks and crannies cling onto creamy sauce and catch all the mix-ins (here, Italian-spiced beef, sweet peas, roasted red peppers, and lots of cheese). No more hunting through strands of spaghetti, then twirling with a fork and spoon—with cavatappi, you can easily curate bite after perfect bite.",
